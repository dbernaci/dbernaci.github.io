<p>Configure Debian 10 machine to be <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/">CIS</a> compliant.</p>
<p>Note: this role will make changes to the system that could break things. This is not an auditing tool but rather a remediation tool to be used after an audit has been conducted.</p>
<p>CIS hardened Debian: cyber attack and malware prevention for mission-critical systems CIS benchmarks lock down your systems by removing: 1. non-secure programs. 2. disabling unused filesystems. 3. disabling unnecessary ports or services. 4. auditing privileged operations. 5. restricting administrative privileges.</p>
<p>CIS benchmark recommendations are adopted in virtual machines in public and private clouds. They are also used to secure on-premises deployments. For some industries, hardening a system against a publicly known standard is a criteria auditors look for. CIS benchmarks are often a system hardening choice recommended by auditors for industries requiring PCI-DSS and HIPPA compliance, such as banking, telecommunications and healthcare. If you are attempting to obtain compliance against an industry-accepted security standard, like PCI DSS, APRA or ISO 27001, then you need to demonstrate that you have applied documented hardening standards against all systems within the scope of assessment.</p>
<p>The Debian CIS benchmarks are organised into different profiles, namely <strong>‘Level 1’</strong> and <strong>‘Level 2’</strong> intended for server and workstation environments.</p>
<p><strong>A Level 1 profile</strong> is intended to be a practical and prudent way to secure a system without too much performance impact. * Disabling unneeded filesystems, * Restricting user permissions to files and directories, * Disabling unneeded services. * Configuring network firewalls.</p>
<p><strong>A Level 2 profile</strong> is used where security is considered very important and it may have a negative impact on the performance of the system. * Creating separate partitions, * Auditing privileged operations</p>
<p>The Debian CIS hardening tool allows you to select the desired level of hardening against a profile (Level1 or Level 2) and the work environment (server or workstation) for a system. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">ansible-playbook</span> -i inventory cis-Debian-20.yaml --tags=<span class="st">&quot;level_1_server&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can list all tags by running the below command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">ansible-playbook</span> -i host run.yaml --list-tags</code></pre></div>
<p>Based on</p>
<pre class="text"><code>CIS Debian Linux 10 Benchmark
v1.0.0 - 02-13-2020</code></pre>
<p><strong>Check Example dir</strong> _________________</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>You should carefully read through the tasks to make sure these changes will not break your systems before running this playbook.</p>
<p>You can download Free CIS Benchmark book from this URL <a href="https://learn.cisecurity.org/benchmarks">Free Benchmark</a></p>
<p>To start working in this Role you just need to install Ansible. <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">Installing Ansible</a></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="role-variables">Role Variables</h2>
<p>You have to review all default configuration before running this playbook, there are many role variables defined in defaults/main.yml.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are considering applying this role to any servers, you should have a basic familiarity with the CIS Benchmark and an appreciation for the impact that it may have on a system.</li>
<li>Read and change configurable default values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of config that should be immediately considered for exclusion:</p>
<p><strong>5.2.18 Ensure SSH access is limited</strong>, which by default effectively limit access to the host (including via ssh).</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CIS-Debian10-Ansible/defaults/main.yml ```YAML</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="section-5">Section 5</h1>
<h1 id="ensure-ssh-access-is-limited">5.2.18 Ensure SSH access is limited</h1>
<p>allowed_users: pippo #Put None or list of users space between each user</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>Also consider skipping tag 1.1.1.7 (Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is limited): the FAT filesystem format is used by UEFI systems for the EFI boot partition.</p>
<p>If you need you to change file templates, you can find it under <code>templates/*</code> directory If you need to change banner, edit banner file in <code>files/*</code> directory</p>
